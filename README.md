# Week 9

# What have I learnt this week? 

-Collective action problem 
-Three specific types of collective problems (public goods problems, congestion problems and renewable resource extraction problems)
-Lyapunov Functions

# What do I 'now know' that I did not before? 

There is no one solution fixes all when it comes to collective action problems. Each scenario must be taken on a case by case basis and the context of the problem is important when identifying the best solution for each individual and as a group. 

# What insights have I gained? 

This week I gained new insights about the three different types of collective action problems, the public goods problem is is relation to individuals who contribue money to funds roads, schools, community and social events and services. Secondly, congestion problems relate to individuals who must restrict the use of resources like road systems, water supply or electricity use and this can reset everyday. Lastly, renewable resource extraction problems relate to individuals who consume resources that can regrow such as seafood or trees. It is possible to solve public goods problems through taxes and it is possible to solve congestion problems through usage fees and restrictions. However, renewable resource problems require careful consideration and planned resolutions. 

The Lyapunov function is named after the Russian mathematician, it is a scale of functions that can be used to prove the stability of an equilibrium. If a process stops then it has reached the point of maximum or minumum state but if it does not stop then it has to take a step into the maximum or minimum state. In contrast to this function, the Markov process also goes into a unique equilibrium however, the Markov process has finite states and fixed transition probabilities where as the Lyapunov can changes states and is also path dependant where as the Markov process is not.

# What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? 

This week I went back to observe the Lyapunov functions, initially I was a bit confused so I decided to research it again and try understand it better.
