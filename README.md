# What have I learnt this week? 

Using the many model approach is valuable in implementing social, economical and environmental change.  It can be used to understand and solves challenges like climate change, managing water resources, reversing trends in obeasity, improving international relations and even predicting natural disasters. New models still have a long way to go but when combined with existing models these models have the ability to improve predictions. 

# What do I 'now know' that I did not before? 

Universitities such as Princeton use probabilistic models that represent applicants by grade point average and test scores when determining their likelihood of graduating. Disney for example used an agent-based model to design its theme parks and attractions. The model created a computer rendition of the theme park and simulated visitors activities so Disney could understand how different decisions may affect the functionality of the theme park. 

The Australian Federal Government uses an economic model that includes income, unemployment, and health statistics to estimate the costs of changes to health care laws.

# What insights have I gained? 

Data helps describe reality, through the use of models understanding data can be difficult. Single models can help however many models work even better and this is the reason why many effective design teams use an ensemble of models. Using many models helps achieve thorough information even from key information that could have been missed from using a single model. Models organise vast amounts of data to help leaders explain phenenoma and visually communicate information, it also helps in strategic decision making by providing the ability to create scenarios and study the affects prior to implementing change.
