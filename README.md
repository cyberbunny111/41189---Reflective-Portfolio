# What have I learnt this week?

A model is a representation of a structure or a real system. Models can be used to explain data, design future models as well as communicate ideas and possibilties. Models help find patterns in data, form predictions based on data, produce new models, estimate any benefits and risks. Using models humans are able to compare different options, identify and rank though processes, design expirements, engineer mechanisms to make and choose better policies. 

# This week I learned about:
There are different ways of representing complex adaptive systems.  

# What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
When designing a model there are three possible roads to take; the embodiment approach, analogy approach or the alternative reality approach. 
# What insights have I gained?

# What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

# What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?


# What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

# What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
