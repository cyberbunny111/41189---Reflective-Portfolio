# What do I 'now know' that I did not before? 
Upon reflection, it was observed that there are two types of random variables, a discreet random variable is calculated by counting e.g number of items purchased in a year. Continuous random variables on the other hand are calculated by measuring e.g a company's stock prices changing in a 52-week period. Understanding probability estimates helps us define occurrence and model our world better.  

## This week I learned about: 

Aggregation - many models in social sciences indicate that 1+2=3 mindset where the aggregation of two components will result in the answer. However, aggregation is more dynamic in its formation meaning all components are interconnected and some components many are not able to form without this bond.  

Probability is the understanding of how likely something is to happen from a random process. Understanding probability helps us understand potential outcomes and how likely those outcomes are.  

# What insights have I gained? 

The average measurement indicates where the curve is on a bell curve/normal distribution and the standard deviation of the measurement indicates how wide and tall the curve is. We see a lot of the normal distribution in nature for example heights, weights, blood pressure and IQ scores. 

  
# This week I gained new insights about: 
Six Sigma aims to reduces the time, defects, variability experiences by processes in a business. It allows businesses to produce a defect free product and less errors in the manufacturing process. It is a combination of two major methodologies: 

1.Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve and Control - existing service, product, models 
2.Define, Measure, Analyse, Design and Verify - new service, product, model 


It is currently used in manufacturing, finance, healthcare, IT and military industry to improve business processes resulting in quality products and services. 

# What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? 

I have found it very challenging to get the motivation to write these repositories and keep up with all the university work. I have been getting very distracted by several other things and I have found it very difficult to concentrate. I was wondering why this is the case, so I googled it and I came across this TedTalk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu4Yvq-g7_Y&ab_channel=TEDxTalks 

 
I feel like I very much agree with Chris Bailey, I feel that with social media, I am constantly hooked on my phone and find it very difficult to stop logging on. Even when I am not using my phone, all I can think about it when I'll go back on it or what is new on the platforms. I feel that like he says on the talk, my brain is over stimulated, making it extremely difficult to concentrate on a task. I find it crazy that my discipline and self-motivation has largely been impacted by my phone and social media, I really want to get back on track and on top of my work. I really wish to perform better and will make my best effort going forward. 


# What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results? 

I have resulted to setting an application limit on my phone to 3 hours of social media per day. It has been hard this week to stick by that but slowly and surely, I'm getting there. Last week I even deactivated all my accounts for a week and still found it difficult to concentrate!
