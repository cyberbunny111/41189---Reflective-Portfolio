# Week 4

# What have I learnt this week?

Systems thinking is more like a philosophy and can mean different things to different people. It often involves analysing data, identifying patterns by understanding this information, we are able to create better and long term solutions. Many believe that systems thinking can 

# What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

A sytem is a part of a whole idea, if you take away a key part the system it will ceases to exist. Ecologically trees all start from seedlings which form roots beneath the soil, grow trunks, branches and leaves. This systems as a whole is fundamental for the survival of humans and all other species on earth, if you were to remove one part of this system, it would lead to a natural disaster esentially destroying food for many species which would result in the end of human life. Systems are made up of interconnected parts, although the structure of a tree is important, the tree is also connected to a vast ecosystem where energy, water and nutrients are distributed.

## This week I learned about:

Types of Information, Technologies, behaviors, beliefs 

N population – Relevant population size 

Riots – if the variable exceed a threshold, individuals take 1-2 actions. Each person makes the choice to join the riot e.g Air Bnb 

Broadcast – spread of ideas, rumors, information through media like television, radio or internet. Number of people informed E.g Contamination in water supply 

Diffusion -  

Contagion -  

SIR – was designed to examine the spread of diseases. Can also be applied to phenomena spread by diffusion then fade e.g books, songs, dance steps, phrases, websites, diets and exercise routines. 

# What insights have I gained?

X is increasingly becoming 

Hard to differentiate between random number theory than the stock market. 

Speed of the decision 

Scope of the decision (fewer correct and incorrect decisions) Standard deviation (narrows when you make more decisions)  

Precise (less desirable) but not accurate (accuracy is more desirable) 


# This week I gained new insights about:

An increasing number of studies have found that ...


# What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

I have found it extremely challenging to feel motivated to write these repositories.  I feel as if I am falling behind and it has been difficult to keep on track with my online discussion work, studying for all subjects and assignments. 

# This week I observed:
  
Scientists / Researchers / Experts have always seen X as

# What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?


# What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
