# Week 8

# What have I learnt this week? 

-Clonel Blotto Game
-The Prisoners Dilemma
-Collective Action Problems

# What do I 'now know' that I did not before? 

The Clonel Blotto game is an idea that there is no best strategy with complicated outcomes. It is a zero sum game which means that there is a winner and a loser and when you have an equal number of troops in the game, it is a question of luck however once you reach a point with unequal troops, you have to try harder and figure out a strategy. 

# This week I learned about: 

The prisoners dilemma theory has two players who can either cooperate or defect. If both choose to cooperate the will be repremanded by for a longer time, if both defect they will repremanded for a shorter time however, if one cooperates and the other defects the one  who coorperates will be rewarded but the one who defected will pay a heavier price. This shows that there is a big difference in doing something good individually to doing something good collectively. 

# What insights have I gained? 

Collective action problems are complex and relevant as it is apart of every system that involves people. A good example of this problem is global warming, if the current international actions are not adequately addressing the rising emissions of green house gasses, it will significantly effect the plants and all life form. 

# What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? 

This week I observed that alot of the content we have been studying about in this subject is heavily related to COVID-19, making all the material relevant and easy to understand as a real life situiation is occuring at the same time we are learning about it. It makes it easier to link the content to the current events. A negative aspect of this would be that I am constantly being reminded of the pandemic and its effects on the world, it is depressing hearing about all the negative effects it has had on our economy and the death tolls.

# What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results? 

Next semester I aim to do all the pre work, online discuissions and start my assignments early and try to add to it a little bit every week. 

# What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this? 

Some theory that proved to be useful this week is that in the Clonel Blotto game it does not matter h
