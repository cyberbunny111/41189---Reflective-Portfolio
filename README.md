# What do I 'now know' that I did not before? 

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics, an understanding of normal distributions needs to be udnerstood to delve into the CLT. Things like data, test scores or vote totals are made up of random variables and when the total numbers are added up normal distribution is achieved. Normal distributions are made up of the mean which is the average value of all the points, the variance which is the average squared from the distance to the mean and finally, a standard deviation which is the square root of the variance. In relevance to the CLT the mean is the highest point in the curve (center), it helps when estimating the value of a variable. 

# What insights have I gained? 

Six sigma is a quality improvement tool used to improve business processes. It helps increase performance, indentify areas of improvement and the quality of products and services. Six sigma quality control for example would involve working to reduce the size of a standards deviation to lower the probabality of faliure.
