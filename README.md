# Week 6 

# What have I learnt this week? 
This week I learnt about:

-Path dependence
-Random walks
-The Markov Process
-Equilibrium

# What do I 'now know' that I did not before? 

Path dependence means what the name indicates, that what happens currently depends on the path taken to get there which is the opposite theory to the Markov process. To understand path dependence there are several models to help distinguish petween processes such as the Urn models. 

# What insights have I gained? 

This week I gained new insights about the Random walks mmodel. 

# What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? 

This week I observed 

# What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results? 

Next time I will try to not procrastinate! I get distracted really easily and I has been very hard to focus.
# What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this? 
Prior to studying this subject I really had no idea that models existed and that that so much research and development went into the study of models. It was incredibly interesting to learn that some of these models are hundreds of years old and that even at simplers times before technology humans were still creating new models,trying to understand how models work and fit into society.
