# What have I learnt this week?

A model is a representation of a structure or a real system. Models can be used to explain data, design future models as well as communicate ideas and possibilties. Models help find patterns in data, form predictions based on data, produce new models, estimate any benefits and risks. Using models humans are able to compare different options, identify and rank though processes, design expirements, engineer mechanisms to make and choose better policies. 

# This week I learned about:
There are different ways of representing complex adaptive systems; through system dynamics models, agent based models and network models. 

# What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
When designing a model there are three possible roads to take; the embodiment approach, analogy approach or the alternative reality approach. 

# What insights have I gained?

# What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

I always thought that I am a fast learner as in the past in my previous workplace, when learning a new system or process, usually I was the first one to understanding and learn it. While studying online I have found that my weakness has been in keeping focus on my work load and time management is a huge weakness for me. 

# What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I have found it challenging to understand how to use Github and Jupyter notebooks. Even after watching the youtube vidoes made by Juan, I am still struggling to understand the difference between the two and when I need to use one or the other. 

# What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

# What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
