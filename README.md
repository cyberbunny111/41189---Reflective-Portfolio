## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week?

Complicated systems need an external force to act on them in order to introduce change. 
Complex systems can observe themselves, learn and adapt. 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

A system can have many boundaries which is influenced by its environment.As the name suggests:

open system is one that can transfer both matter and energy to its environment e.g most eco systems.

closed system is one that transfers only energy not matter e.g earth

isolated system is one that has no ability to transfer either beyond its boundary layer e.g a lab expierement 


### What insights have I gained?

Systems have structure but are defined by its composition and matter and energy.
Systems have behaviour inclusive of information, energy and input and ouputs.
A system cannot exist without its environment, structure and purpose.


### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?



### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?


### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?


### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
