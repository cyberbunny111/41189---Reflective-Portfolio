# What have I learnt this week? 

This is week I got some feedback from my peers about our Github Pre-submission. The feedback from them was constructive and helped me identify what was missing from our submission. The teams highlighted many positives from our work; saying that it was relevant to our current global situiation and that work clearly specified our aim and defined our scope of the Australian housing market and its effects since COVID. Some of the feedback my team recieved from our peers were to add more positives to the current situiation like:

-Rental reduction
-JobKeeper & JobSeeker benefits
-Homebuilder grant
-People spending more time with their families due to moving back home
-Lockdown benefits e.g home cooking, excersize, community support and new experiences

# What do I 'now know' that I did not before? 

Complexity science is a relativelyy new field which began in the 1980's. According to Allen Downey classic models tend to be based on continuous mathematics, linear systems, are deterministic and homogenous. On the other hand, complexity science is more open to linear models, includes some degree of randomness, often include heterogeneity and work with a large number of components. 


Complex models are good for different purposes and although Schelling's model of segregation might be useful for complex social circumstances, it is not useful for prediction. Reductionism is the idea that the behavious of a systme can be explained by understading its components where as holism is based on the opposite. 

# What insights have I gained? 

This week I gained new insights about small world experiments and how it is comprised of several experiments that was conducted by Stanley Milgram. The intension was to examine the average path lenth of social networks of people in the US. It was interesting to learn that this experiment suggested that human society is a small world type of network characterized by short path lengths. The idea was to learn about the probability that two randomly selected people would know eachother, this reminds me of Facebook and how we have suggested friends. In real life these suggest friends would be someone we know randomly however on Facebook its easy to see this due to the mutal friends function on the profiles.


# What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? 

This week I found my self staying on top of my work more, we recieved great feedback from Juan about our assessment which was quite motivating and helped alot with our self esteem. 

# What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results? 

Next semester I will try to leave more time for myself, its hard working and studying on the same day as im often flustered. Perhaps next semester I will try to coordinate working on different days to my class days and see how this works. It all a learning process and I've tried this way this semester and have found it difficut to manage both. 

# What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this? 
A large scale Milgram's experiment was conducted whcih involved 24,163 email chains with 18 targets around the world and the average chain was 6. The small world experiment also corroborates with Granovetters theory "the strength of weak ties" that keeps a social network together.
