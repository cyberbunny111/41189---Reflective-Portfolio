# What have I learnt this week? 

Using the many model approach is valuable in implementing social, economical and environmental change.  It can be used to understand and solves challenges like climate change, managing water resources, reversing trends in obeasity, improving international relations and even predicting natural disasters. New models still have a long way to go but when combined with existing models these models have the ability to improve predictions. 

# What do I 'now know' that I did not before? 


# What insights have I gained? 

Data helps describe reality, through the use of models understanding data can be difficult. Single models can help however many models work even better and this is the reason why many effective design teams use an ensemble of models. 

# What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? 


# What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results? 

# What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
