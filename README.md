## Week 1

### What have I learnt this week?

This week I have learnt  that complicated systems need an external force to act on them in order to introduce change. 

Whilst, complex systems can observe themselves, therefore learn and adapt by itself. 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

A system can have many boundaries which is influenced by its environment. As the name suggests:

open system is one that can transfer both matter and energy to its environment e.g most eco systems.

closed system is one that transfers only energy not matter e.g earth

isolated system is one that has no ability to transfer either beyond its boundary layer e.g a lab expierement 


### What insights have I gained?

Systems have structure but are defined by its composition and matter and energy.
Systems have behaviour inclusive of information, energy and input and ouputs.
A system cannot exist without its environment, structure and purpose.


### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A weakness I noticed this week was that I always thought I was a fast learner but upon starting this degree this year I have found myself to be a slow learner. I think when it comes to learning something at work that is systems based I pick it up quickly and through repetition I remember processes. But when it comes to online learning I have found it very difficult to understand concepts at a quicker pace. 


### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
This week nothing was challenging, as I have kept ontop on my homework and activites. 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time I will read through the learning material prior to the class. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
When reading the online discussion material, I found the book very interesting. I really enjoyed learning about the different system elements and how the different systems interact.
