# Week 7

# What have I learnt this week? 

This week I learnt about:
-Power laws
-The Central Limit Theorem
-Social learning (Replicator dynamics)
-Segregation (Schelling's segregation model)

# What do I 'now know' that I did not before? 

Power laws are relationships between two quantaties, one quantity and its relationship/change  to another quantity. It is often displayed in situiations that are long-tailed distributions. Many businesses use the power law distributions to understand its market to concentrate on a niche. Some examples include income distribution, venture capatilist funds, population sizes of cities in a region and even followers on social media. 

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics, an understanding of normal distributions needs to be udnerstood to delve into the CLT. Things like data, test scores or vote totals are made up of random variables and when the total numbers are added up normal distribution is achieved. Normal distributions are made up of the mean which is the average value of all the points, the variance which is the average squared from the distance to the mean and finally, a standard deviation which is the square root of the variance. In relevance to the CLT the mean is the highest point in the curve (center), it helps when estimating the value of a variable. 

# What insights have I gained? 

Six sigma is a quality improvement tool used to improve business processes. It helps increase performance, indentify areas of improvement and the quality of products and services. Six sigma quality control for example would involve working to reduce the size of a standards deviation to lower the probabality of faliure. 

Segregation patterns develop from agent-based models such as the Schelling, Granovetter and the Standing ovation model. Agent based models can be identified by using people, examining their behaviours and looking at the out comes.

Granovetter's model is based on the events driven by extremes often in contagion cases where a small movement/group is driven to a larger field. A good example of this model is big events in history such as riots, revolutions and the BLM movement. 

# What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? 

The python coding was a huge challenge for my team and I, so Shino our group leader reached out to Juan for help. 

# What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results? 

I will work towards making weekly inputs into my reposotories.
# What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this? 

Schellings model of segregation proved to be useful because I've always wondered why it is that certain races and social groups live in certain areas. In this model  two types of agents are placed in a grid to understand whether each agent is satisfied with its current location and a satisfied agent is one that is surrounded by a percentage of agents like itself.
