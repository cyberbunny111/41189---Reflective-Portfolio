# Week 10

# What have I learnt this week? 

This week there was alot of focus on the Clonel Blotto Game, it is a model which predicts the winner based on the number of front won. The main idea of the game is that it is more beneficial to win across multiple games as opposed to focusing all your energy on winning one game. 

# What do I 'now know' that I did not before? 



# What insights have I gained? 

This week I gained new insights about 

# What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? 

This week I observed  

# What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results? 

Sadly, I missed the chance to participate in the game. I was doing other assessments although that is not a good excuse but next time I will submit my entry right away so I do not miss out.

# What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
