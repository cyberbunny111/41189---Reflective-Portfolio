# Week 12

# What have I learnt this week? 

Using the many model approach is valuable in implementing social, economical and environmental change.  It can be used to understand and solves challenges like climate change, managing water resources, reversing trends in obeasity, improving international relations and even predicting natural disasters. New models still have a long way to go but when combined with existing models these models have the ability to improve predictions. 

# What do I 'now know' that I did not before? 

Universitities such as Princeton use probabilistic models that represent applicants by grade point average and test scores when determining their likelihood of graduating. Disney for example used an agent-based model to design its theme parks and attractions. The model created a computer rendition of the theme park and simulated visitors activities so Disney could understand how different decisions may affect the functionality of the theme park. This is interesting because these virtual agents created with the ability to operate without the direct instructions of humans or others (so in a way they have some control over their own actions), they have the ability to communicate with other agents, they are able to percieve their environment and they exihibit goal-orientated behaviour. I have found this information to be interesting and challenging to understand as it seems as though these qualaities and behaviours these virtual agents possess as very similar to that of humans.

# What insights have I gained? 

Data helps describe reality, through the use of models understanding data can be difficult. Single models can help however many models work even better and this is the reason why many effective design teams use an ensemble of models. Using many models helps achieve thorough information even from key information that could have been missed from using a single model. Models organise vast amounts of data to help leaders explain phenenoma and visually communicate information, it also helps in strategic decision making by providing the ability to create scenarios and study the affects prior to implementing change. 

# What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? 

This week Taylor and I are working on our part of the final assessment, we are doing the Markov Model part of the assessment together. We scheduled to meet up during our normal class time at the campus. Our focus is on creating and testin g the Pythonn code for the Markov model and in addition to this I worked on analysis the similarities between the random walks model and the Markov process. We have found a couple of websites and Github reposotories relating to a Python code for the model however, a huge challenge is actually altering the code so that it aligns with our topic of COVID-19 and the Australian housing market.  

# What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results? 

I think next time I would focus more of my energy and time in doing my weekly submissions. Hopefully, by next semester I will be able to have my classes on campus because I think it will much easier for me to concentrate in a classroom environment and I will enjoy it alot more. 

# What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this? 
Some theory that proved to be useful is that complex systems are all around us and we interact with it everyday sometimes even unconciously. Some systems were created by nature like our brains and how they work, ecosystems and gene networks and some systems were created by humans such as the stock market, language, urban cities and political systems.
