# Week 3
# What have I learnt this week?

This week  learnt about what models people follow, humans follow a combination of rational, behavioural and rule-based models. The rational model indicates that if a person has a goal/objective, they will try to maximise the outcome and depending on their level of altruism this can change their behaviour. The behavioural approach indicates that humans are products of conditioning and behaviour is a natural response to the environment around them. Rule-based modelling is based on how a person acts based on fixed rules they have created for themsevles or if they act based on on adaptive rules which can change depending on others people aaround them.

This week I have found it challenging to study from home. I have been getting distracted easily and making excuses for myself not to do the work. I made a study calendar and have put it on my desk to help me manage my time and allocate 3 hours of study each day. I have also downloaded a timetable/homework application called 'my Homework' on my laptop to help me keep on top of my assignements.
