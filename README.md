# Week 9

# What have I learnt this week? 

-Collective action problem 
-Three specific types of collective problems (public goods problems, congestion problems and renewable resource extraction problems)

# What do I 'now know' that I did not before? 

This week I learned about 

There is no one solution fixes all when it comes to collective action problems. Each scenario must be taken on a case by case basis and the context of the problem is important when identifying the best solution for each individual and as a group. 

# What insights have I gained? 

This week I gained new insights about the three different types of collective action problems, the public goods problem is is relation to individuals who contribue money to funds roads, schools, community and social events and services. Secondly, congestion problems relate to individuals who must restrict the use of resources like road systems, water supply or electricity use and this can reset everyday. Lastly, renewable resource extraction problems relate to individuals who consume resources that can regrow such as seafood or trees. It is possible to solve public goods problems through taxes and it is possible to solve congestion problems through usage fees and restrictions. However, renewable resource problems require careful consideration and planned resolutions. 

# What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? 

This week I observed 

# What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results? 

# What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
