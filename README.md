# Week 3
# What have I learnt this week?

This week  learnt about what models people follow, humans follow a combination of rational, behavioural and rule-based models. The rational model indicates that if a person has a goal/objective, they will try to maximise the outcome and depending on their level of altruism this can change their behaviour. The behavioural approach indicates that humans are products of conditioning and behaviour is a natural response to the environment around them. Rule-based modelling is based on how a person acts based on fixed rules they have created for themsevles or if they act based on on adaptive rules which can change depending on others people aaround them.

# What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Decison trees are used to design a course of action, a map of all possible outcomes is drawn up to find the best decision. The descrete signalling model is comprised of three parts, this being pooling, seperating and partial pooling. 

## This week I learned about:

Decision making models are model about how people make decisions or how they should make decisions. The first part of decision making is how a person percieves the problem or task at hand. 

# What insights have I gained?

Recombination is the art of combiniting heuristics and different perspectives to create better heurisics and perspectives. 

# This week I gained new insights about:

Multi-criterion Decision Making is the concept that there are several things you need to take into consideration when making a decision that it going to make you the happiest.

Spatial Choice Models

Probability, types of probality and decision tree

# What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?


# What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
This week I have found it challenging to study from home. I have been getting distracted easily and making excuses for myself not to do the work. I made a study calendar and have put it on my desk to help me manage my time and allocate 3 hours of study each day. I have also downloaded a timetable/homework application called 'my Homework' on my laptop to help me keep on top of my assignements.

# This week I observed:
  
Whilst learning about his week I observed myself 
# What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

I submitted my Github repository quite late. I have come to realisation that 
# What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
