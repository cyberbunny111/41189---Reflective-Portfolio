# Week 10

# What have I learnt this week? 

This week there was alot of focus on the Clonel Blotto Game, it is a model which predicts the winner based on the number of front won. The main idea of the game is that it is more beneficial to win across multiple games as opposed to focusing all your energy on winning one game. It helps to strategically allocate resources in multiple dimensions and the game has been used widely in economics to model contests such as political campaigns, research and development races and litigation applications. 

# What do I 'now know' that I did not before? 

In the Clonel Blotto game there is an advantage for the player with the most troops. If you are the weak player you need to add dimensions to increase your chance of winning for example if it's business, then you need to add a point of difference, if your playing a sports game, then you need to add tricks or unpredictable moves.

# What insights have I gained? 

This week I gained new insights about the Clonel Blotto game and how it is used across business and in social circumstances. A good example of this is on the Canvas Module in Week 8, in trials lawyers often compete over different lines of defence and the resources they use is in the time that was spent preparing for each defence. So they really have to consider how much time to spend on each defence to win the most cases rather than just making only one strong case. 

# What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them? 

This week I observed an improvement in my ability to focus and work on my assignments. I have tried really hard to add a little bit each day and doing thiks has taken weight off my shoulders and I have been able to successfully complete my assignments on time.

# What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results? 

Sadly, I missed the chance to participate in the game. I was doing other assessments although that is not a good excuse but next time I will submit my entry right away so I do not miss out.
